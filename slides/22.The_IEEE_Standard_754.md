# The IEEE Standard 754
* Defines floating-point number systems and their rounding behaviour (radix binary and decimal [IEEE 2019])
* Is used nearly everywhere 
* Single precision (float) numbers:
￼ (32-bit) plus ￼
* Double precision (double) numbers:
￼ (64-bit) plus ￼
* All arithmetic operations round the exact result to the next representable number
