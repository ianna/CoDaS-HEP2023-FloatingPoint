# Floating-point Number Systems
A finite floating point number system is a finite subset of $`R`$.

Floating-point number system is defined by the four natural numbers: 
￼ 
 * $`b\ge 2`$, the radix, (2 or 10)
 * $`p\ge 1`$, the precision (the number of of digits in the significand)
 * ￼$`e_{min}`$, the largest possible exponent
 * ￼$`e_{max}`$, the smallest possible exponent, (shall be ￼ for all formats)

Notation:

￼$`F(b,p, e_{min}, e_{max})`$

The set $`F(b,p, e_{min}, e_{max})`$ of real numbers represented by this system consists of all floating-point numbers of the form:
