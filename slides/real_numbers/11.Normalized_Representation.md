# Normalized Representation

Normalized number:

$`\pm d_0.d_1 ... d_{p-1} \times b^e`$, $`d_0 \ne 0`$

The normalized representation is unique and therefore preferred.

The number 0, as well as all numbers smaller than $`b^{e_{min}}`$, have no normalized representation.

Set of normalized numbers:

$`F^*(b, p, e_{min}, e_{max})`$
